# no-children-count

## Rule category

Restriction.

## What it does

Prevents usage of `Children.count`.

## Why is this bad?

Using `Children` is uncommon and can lead to fragile code. [See common alternatives](https://react.dev/reference/react/Children#alternatives).

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx {7}
import { Children } from "react";

function RowList({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Error: Do not use Children.count */}
      <h1>Total rows: {Children.count(children)}</h1>
      ...
    </>
  );
}
```
