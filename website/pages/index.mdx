Welcome to the ESLint React documentation.

A series of composable ESLint rules for libraries and frameworks that use React as a UI runtime.

## Features

- **Universal** rules for libraries and frameworks that use React as a UI runtime.
- **Well designed** rule behaviors and sensible defaults.
- **Maximum flexibility** through minimum configuration options.

## Public packages

### All-in-one plugins

- [`@eslint-react/eslint-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eslint-react/eslint-plugin) - The main ESLint plugin package including all rules and config presets in this repository.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the purpose of `eslint-react`?

The purpose of `eslint-react` is to provide ESLint plugins for not just for React DOM but also other libraries and frameworks that use React as a UI runtime.

### What are the differences between `eslint-plugin-react-x` and `eslint-plugin-react`?

The main difference is that `eslint-plugin-react-x` can be used with any render target library or framework, while `eslint-plugin-react` will always assume that you are using React DOM, even if you are working on a project that only uses React Three Fiber (you can learn more about this through encounters like [1] and [2] ).

### Is `eslint-plugin-react-x` a replacement for `eslint-plugin-react`?

**No, `eslint-plugin-react-x` is not a drop-in replacement for `eslint-plugin-react`**. But you can still use it as a replacement if you wish. Keep in mind that some rules may behave differently, and that the rules provided by `eslint-react` are more in line with [react.dev](https://react.dev/). This is because `eslint-plugin-react-x` will consider [react.dev](https://react.dev/) instead of `eslint-plugin-react` as the source of truth.
